# JavaGame
Make a Java game in 100 hours 

You can read about the task in the file "Obligatorisk opgave" but to make it short we got the task to learn how to make a game in Java
with or without javaFXGL. Some of my classmates are using GODOT or we could chose to learn Python in 100 hours following a tutorial 
making 5 small games.
